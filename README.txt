There are two scenarios: 1) Tourism and 2) Vaccination.

Scenario 1) Tourism.
For the query "Gateway of India", we show the JSON response and the map with a layer of crowd density. Density information helps in decision making on when to visit. 

Scenario 2) Vaccination.
For the query "King George Hospital", we show the JSON response and the map with a layer of crowd density. Users may choose to visit at a time when it is less crowded.

You may press the "Play" button under the map to watch a simulation of density over time.
